    ```

### Explore the Quick Chat features

The Quick Chat window is a simplified interface for interacting with GitHub Copilot. It provides a quick way to ask questions, request code suggestions, or get help with specific tasks without leaving the code editor.

1. Open the Copilot Chat menu and notice that three Chat options are listed.

    ![Screenshot showing the Copilot Chat menu with inline chat disabled.](./Media/m01-github-copilot-menu-chat-options.png)

    The three Chat options are:

    - Open Chat: This option is used to open the Chat view.

    - Editor Inline Chat: This option is used to interact with GitHub Copilot directly in the code editor. The Inline Chat option is only enabled when there's a file open in the editor.

    - Quick Chat: This option is used to interact with GitHub Copilot using a simplified interface. You can use quick chat to ask questions, request code suggestions, or get help with specific tasks without leaving the code editor.

1. On the Copilot Chat menu, select **Quick Chat**.

    By default, the Quick Chat window opens at the top center of the Visual Studio Code window.

1. Notice that the Quick Chat window provides many of the same options provided with the Chat view.

1. Use the Quick Chat window to submit the following prompt:

    ```text
    Tell me about the Program.cs file
    ```

    Without additional context, the response is likely to be a description of how Program.cs files are used in various project types.

1. To add your Program.cs file to the Quick Chat context, drag-and-drop the Program.cs file from the Explorer view to the top of the Quick Chat window.

1. Notice that the Quick Chat window now includes **Program.cs** to the right of the **Add Context** button.

    > **TIP**: Adding project files to the Chat context (Chat view, Quick Chat, or Inline Chat) helps GitHub Copilot provide more relevant suggestions. When adding project files to the Chat context, it's often easier to use a drag-and-drop operation rather than the Add Context button.

1. Scroll to the top of the Quick Chat window and resubmit the same prompt:

    ```text
    Tell me about the Program.cs file
    ```

1. Notice that the new response describes the contents of your Program.cs file rather than a general description of how Program.cs files are used.

1. In the top-right corner of the Quick Chat window, select **Open in Chat View**.

    Notice that the Quick Chat window closes and the Chat view opens with responses that appeared the Quick Chat window. If the Chat view doesn't display the Quick Chat session, use the Copilot Chat menu to open the Quick Chat window, and then select **Open in Chat View**.

    Switching to the Chat view is useful when you need to extend and manage a chat session that started in the Quick Chat window.

    > **TIP**: The Quick Chat window is great for quick questions and simple tasks. However, if you want a more dedicated Chat environment, you should use the Chat view. The Chat view provides a more comprehensive interface for interacting with GitHub Copilot and includes features like chat history, file management, and more advanced options for managing your chat sessions.

### Explore the Inline Chat features

The Inline Chat interface is designed for code interactions directly within the editor. It provides a more focused and streamlined experience for working with code, allowing you to ask questions, request code suggestions, and make edits without leaving the code editor.

    - **Apply to Program.cs**: Use the Apply to Program.cs option to apply the suggested code update to the Program.cs file.
    - **Insert at Cursor**: Use the Insert at Cursor option to insert the suggested code update at the current cursor position in the editor.
    - **Copy**: Use the Copy option to copy the suggested code update to the clipboard.

1. In the Chat view, select **Set Mode**, and then select **Edit**.

1. If a message is displayed telling you that changing the Chat mode terminates the current Chat session, select **Yes** to start a new Chat session, and then resubmit the following prompt:

    ```text

    refactor selection to display "Generate equations for addition and subtraction:"

    ```

1. Take a minute to review the updates suggested in the code editor.

    ![Screenshot showing an Inline Chat session with a response in the code editor.](./Media/m01-github-copilot-chat-view-response-edit-mode.png)

    Notice the following:

    - The code editor displays a *Diff-style* view that shows the changes made to the code, similar to the Diff view used in GitHub pull requests.
    - The code editor displays **Keep** and **Undo** buttons that you can use to apply or reject the changes made to the code.
    - The code editor displays additional buttons that can be used manage the suggested edits.

    In addition to the edit controls displayed the editor tab, the Chat view displays a **Keep** button that you can use to apply all edits and an **Undo** button to cancel the edits, and an abbreviated description of the suggested update.

1. In the Chat view, select **Keep** to apply the suggested code updates.

> **NOTE**: The Chat view's Agent mode is designed for running tasks using an autonomous agent. To conserve GitHub Copilot resources, the Agent mode isn't used in this exercise.

### Explore code completion suggestions

GitHub Copilot provides code completion suggestions based on the context of the code in the editor. You can use code completion suggestions to quickly generate code snippets, refactor existing code, or implement new features.

1. With the Program.cs file open in the code editor, position the cursor at the end of the Console.WriteLine statement.

1. To generate a code completion suggestion, press **Enter**.

    GitHub Copilot generates a code completion suggestion based on the context of the code in the editor. In this case, GitHub Copilot suggests a new Console.WriteLine statement that's related to generating equations    .
